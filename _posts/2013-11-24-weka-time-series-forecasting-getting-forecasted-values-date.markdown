Here's an example of programmatically getting predicted values' date and time using Weka and pentaho's Java APIs. Recently, I've had to use Weka via their Java libraries to predict future electricity prices. What bothered me was that getting the forecasted price was easy, but getting the date and time of that forecasted price deemed more tricky than expected.

This example builds on pentaho's own example on predicting future wine sales numbers for "Fortified" and "Dry-white" based on data from previous sales.

You will need the pentaho Time Series Analysis plugin, which can be downloaded via the package manager included in Weka >= 3.7.3. It includes the Java libraries and documentation needed to follow their example and the following example.

This simple example also loads in the amazing Joda-Time library for Java that replaces Java's classes to manage time (link [here](http://www.joda.org/joda-time/)). The API is amazing and has a collection of really helpful helper classes that make managing time much much easier. This library, while not required, is used in the following to make sense of the value you get back from the forecaster: number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch.

I'm sure you can figure out what to do if you wish not to use Joda-Time.

The basic layout is exactly the same as pentaho's API example [here](http://wiki.pentaho.com/display/DATAMINING/Time+Series+Analysis+and+Forecasting+with+Weka#TimeSeriesAnalysisandForecastingwithWeka-4UsingtheAPI), bar for a couple lines. Here we're interested in getting the datetime object representing the forecasted data. That is done by adding the following two methods to their example:

{% highlight java %}
  private DateTime getCurrentDateTime(TSLagMaker lm) throws Exception {
    return new DateTime((long)lm.getCurrentTimeStampValue());
  }

  private DateTime advanceTime(TSLagMaker lm, DateTime dt) {
    return new DateTime((long)lm.advanceSuppliedTimeValue(dt.getMillis()));
  }
{% endhighlight %}

The first method merely reads whatever the latest time the forecaster knows about and makes turns it into a Joda-Time DateTime object.

The second method advances the forecaster with one unit, a single day in this case.

And here is the full copy-pastable example. All that is introduced, are the two methods above and a call to each on lines 61 and 77, respectfully:
