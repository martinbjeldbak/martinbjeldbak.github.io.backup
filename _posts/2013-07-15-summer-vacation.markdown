After a prolonged break from writing any blog posts (or writing anything at all, for that matter) over the past two semesters - since last summerâ€¦ really, I have finally gotten back the time and desire to write a little update.

I want to start out with lists, because who doesn't love lists?

To reflect, the things I'm happy I've done for myself the past couple of months are:

- Exams have gone very well and I'm quite proud of myself
- Feeling like my knowledge and understanding in the field of computer science is expanding
- Keeping a private diary updated almost daily with pictures and descriptions of my thoughts keeps me happy - I'm already enjoying looking back
- Working out 3 times a week has completely changed my body. I eventually want to look like [this](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-e5lLjgTWwWQ/UQiN8vYSnLI/AAAAAAAAXr4/tM3AyJ316kg/s320/Dan_Feuerriegel_Main2.jpg) guy ;)
- Watching the red wedding temporarily stopped me from reading A Storm of Swords, argh!

And to keep myself motivated, here is a checklist of things I have vaguely planned to accomplish during my vast 2 months of vacation time, in no particular order:

- Watch a couple movies a week
- Experiment cooking different meals now that I have the time
- Work on side projects that've been put on hold while I've been studying/socializing/crashing, these include:
    - An update to an improvement of the Moodle CMS calendar system, [moodle2google](https://github.com/Fapper/moodle2google) **Edit:** Done!
    - A little Minecraft plugin, just to play with the API
    - An iOS app, because who isn't writing those nowadays?
    - A Spree webshop (in the making)
- Work at my student job
- Get in shape enough to run 5 km in under 22 minutes at this Autumn's [Unirun](http://unirun.aau.dk/) (20 minutes if I'm a boss)
- Help out at this year's Software Development Camp in Aalborg, [SDC](http://software.unf.dk) late July-early August
- Attend the 2013 Belgian Grand Prix at Spa in August. I CANNOT wait! Let's just hope it doesn't start like [last year's](http://www.formula1.com/video/?uid=2012090212R)
- Read one or two books I have laying around on my shelf along with various blogs (RIP Google Reader)
- And finally, RELAX!

All in all it's turning out to be a quite interesting summer full of fun events planned with extremely cool people. On top of that, I'm already excited to start 5<sup>th</sup> semester come this september.
