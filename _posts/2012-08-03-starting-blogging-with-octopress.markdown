Officially my first post, woohoo!

Having spent the past couple of days looking into how Octopress works and setting it up to my tastes, I now feel comfortable enough to use it to churn out some content.

## My goals with this blog

Defining why I'm doing this and what my long term goals are is important to me, because it helps give me a feel for what I want to get out of this and focus my attention on. You as a reader will also know what to expect, and if you're reading this from the future, then hopefully the next few paragraphs will coincide with the current theme of the posts on this blog.

That said, I will mostly be doing this for myself, to keep track of what I'm concentrating/working on, as documentation for things I might forget, and to broaden my know-how of technical things and the English language. Though if my posts interest you and you enjoy reading this blog, then I'm happiest person ever.

## What will I be posting about?

I will mostly be posting about things that interest me, which mostly consist of:

- Programming: interesting things and struggles I come across, academically and in my free time
- Programs: Cool programs I can't live without, possibly writing a review or two!
- Gaming: As an avid gamer, I plan to share some thoughts on different video games and their genres (FPS, MMO, and indie titles are what I play, when I have time to play)
- Health and well-being: what an exercise routine looks like and how to optimize it, healthy living & eating habits
- Entertainment and media: movies, TV shows I'm watching, books, and so on
- Random things that I can't find a category for

All my future blog posts will be tagged (hopefully with the above categories) so they're easy to find and can be sorted according to your interests.

## Further motivations for this blog..

I feel having this will be an aid helping me learn and get a feel for what it's like to express myself in a public environment, and I will hopefully pick up some linguistic skills that suit a wider audience.

The fact that this could possibly be used to share valuable knowledge, such as interesting things I've learned and things I'm in the process of learning would help keep me motivated to continue learning.

## Summing up

Started as a summer project, I hope this blog will help my define public profile (shameless marketing), as I'm striving to be more open, productive, and active on this vast series of tubes.

This blog will help me learn, keep track of what I'm spending my time, energy, and brainpower on, and keep me motivated to learn. It will be used as a reference, hopefully not only by me.

My goal is to post at least once a week, let's hope I can live up to it!

## Fun links I think you should check out
Here is a list of blogs and feeds that I follow:

- [Summer Tomato](http://summertomato.com/): A blog on healthy eating and living, from someone with a PhD in neuroscience
- [Valve Linux Blog](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/): Valve blogs about their development of Steam and (currently) Left 4 Dead 2 on the Linux platform… very interesting
- [Udacity](http://www.udacity.com/): Free university style courses spanning lots of different subjects
- [TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/): The best news site (in my opinion) for updates on technology and new startups

I hope this list can be constantly updated…
