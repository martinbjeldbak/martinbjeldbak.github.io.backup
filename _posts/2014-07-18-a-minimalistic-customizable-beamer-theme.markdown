This simple theme is based upon Cameron Bracken's theme that I really liked, but had a couple of gripes with. The original is posted [here](http://cameron.bracken.bz/beamer-template). I made my own modifications, such as adding a footer, page numbers, and simplifying it a bit. By no means am I a designer, but I'm happy with the results of hacking a little bit on his theme.

We happily used this theme to present our bachelor project in Computer Science, so it has been tested in practice!

## Usage
My theme can be downloaded by right-clicking and saving file: [beamerthemebjeldbak.sty](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{{ site.github_username }}/beamertheme-bjeldbak/master/beamerthemebjeldbak.sty), or cloning [{{ site.github_username }}/beamertheme-bjeldbak](https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}/beamertheme-bjeldbak) on GitHub. Then simply point to the ``beamerthemebjeldbak.sty`` file with the ``\usetheme{}`` macro.

See the repo for a minimum working example.

## Customizing

## Conlcusions
Hope you like it! The TeX code for this theme can be found in the GitHub repo [{{ site.github_username }}/beamertheme-bjeldbak](https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}/beamertheme-bjeldbak). Feel free to let me know if I can improve it in anyway.
